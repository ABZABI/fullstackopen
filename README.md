# Full Stack Web Development Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository for Full Stack Web Development! This repository serves as a place for me to practice and explore the world of web development through the Full Stack Open course by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

## Course Information

The Full Stack Open course is an excellent resource for anyone looking to gain knowledge in full-stack web development. You can find the course material and more information at [Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, showcase the projects I work on, and practice the skills I gain throughout the course. This repository will be continuously updated as I complete exercises, projects, and learn new concepts.

Feel free to explore the code and projects within this repository. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
